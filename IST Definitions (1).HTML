<p><b>IP</b> stands for internet protocol, which is a series of laws and regulations put in place to govern people’s computer networks and sending and receiving data on the internet</p>
<p><b>IP Address</b> is a series of 4 3 digit numbers, separated by full stops, which are used to identify every user and their computer on the network. It is somewhat like a street address for computers on the internet, because it gives computers an address, when the coomputer sends a message, it is like sending a letter to a friend, the other person can trace your address. An example of an IP address is 153.107.192.208</p>
<p><b>Binary</b> is a system of counting numbers. It is quite different from the classic decimal system, since instead of going up by x10, it goes up by x2. Everything in computers work because of the binary system, consisted of 0s and 1s. Binary means there are only two values, so only two options for you to pick, it could be reperesented by 0 and 1, 0 could mean off, which means that this value is not been used, and 1 could mean on, which means we are using that value. Looking at an example, 110100, instead of the place values going up by x10, each time we x2, so the first value is in the 2^0 column, the second one is in the 2^1, third one in 2^2, etc. Then we multiply the 0s and 1s by the values we just figured out, we get, from left to right, 64, 32, 0, 8, 0, 0. Add them together, we get 104, so 110100 in the decimal system is 104</p> 
<p><b>Decimal</b> The decimal system is a system of counting numbers. Each place value has a base of 10, the first place value is 10^0, then 10^1, 10^2, etc. It is quite different to the binary system, which has inlu 1 and 0, this system uses the integers from 0-9. For example 123 is 1x10^2, 2x10^1 and 3x10^0. This system isn't used in computers since there could be errors when transmitting the signal through copper wires, instead of having so many values and leave the message with lots of errors, it is easier and safer to use the binary system, which has little mistakes, since it is only 1 and 0, on and off.</p> 
<p><b>Digital and Analog</b> A digital signal is a signal which is transferred by bits, which is a series of 1s and 0s.It is much less error prone since it is only made of on and off. Even if the system makes a mistake when transmitting a signal, the receiving side can still estimate it to on or off, and it is uaually correct. An analog system, on the other hand, usually makes lots of mistakes since instead of 2 values, it has nine values, and the system often makes too many mistakes so that the signal on the other side is completely different than the signal which was sent.

<p><b>Bit and Byte</b> Bits are the basic unit of measuring the amount of data and information is stored on a computer. A bit is just a 1 or a 0, if data is processed at 5 bits per second, then it has a series of 5 1s and 0s. When you get a series of 8 bits, you get a byte, which is the smallest unit when measuring memory in computer systems. Since the connection speeds are so fast during ur times, we rarely need to measure in bits. So we keep going up units from byte, and that is how we get kilobyte (1024 bytes), megabytes (1024 kilobytes), etc. 
<p><b>Bandwidth</b> It is the maximum amount of data a wired or wireless link can send. It is basically the data capacity a communications link can hold. The banwidth is traditionally expressed as bits per second (bps), but now that the technology is better, we generally measure in a million bits per second (megabyte), or a billion bits per second (gigabytes). And the more bandwidth a connection has, the more data it can send and receive at a given time. Greater bandwidth often means more money spent. users have to pay more money to get greater bandwidth. You can basically think of this as a pipe, the more oney you spend on expanding the pipe, the more thing can flow in it.</p>
